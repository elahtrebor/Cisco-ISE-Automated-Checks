# Cisco-ISE-Automated-Checks
These snippets will help test that Cisco ISE authentication is working. 
A quick set of perl scripts that check TACACS and Radius authentication against a Cisco ISE server. Note the TACACS checking script uses Authen::TacacsPlus module.

Also the RADIUS testing script uses RADTEST utility.

Tested on Redhat Linux 7.
